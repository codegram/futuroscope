  # A Future is an object that gets initialized with a block and will behave
  # exactly like the block's result, but being able to "borrow" its result from
  # the future. That is, will block when the result is not ready until it is,
  # and will return it instantly if the thread's execution already finished.

    # Initializes a future with a block and starts its execution.

    #
    #   future = Futuroscope::Future.new { sleep(1); :edballs }
    #   sleep(1)
    #   puts future
    #   => :edballs

    #   # deferred to a thread.
